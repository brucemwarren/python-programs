# Program to print out the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer (On The Wall)"
#
# The Rules:
#
# If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in
# function.
# Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
# Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
# Put a blank line between each verse of the song.
